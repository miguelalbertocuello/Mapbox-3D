# Mapbox-3D

Map created with Mapbox Studio, where typography and styles were added and the color palette was modified.

It was then added to a basic HTML page using Javascript and the Mapbox GL library.
Basic user controls such as search box, zoom, user position and coordinate display on the screen were incorporated.
